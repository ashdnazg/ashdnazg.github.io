{% include project-github.html name="Spring RTS" link="https://springrts.com" github="spring/spring" %}

A powerful 3D Real-Time-Strategy game engine.

I was a core engine developer between 2015 and 2019, mostly working on simulation, serialisation and performance optimisation. I still solve the odd bug every now and then.

I gave a talk about the adventures of releasing Spring games on Steam in [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2022/) 2020. ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfUBS63YgN0), [Slides](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/gamedev_spring_steam/attachments/slides/3786/export/events/attachments/gamedev_spring_steam/slides/3786/odyssey.pdf))

Earlier, I've been a developer in the team of [Spring: 1944](https://github.com/spring1944/spring1944).

{% include project-github.html name="Pyreshark" github="ashdnazg/pyreshark" %}
A [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) plugin providing a simple interface for writing packet dissectors in python. Not a game but quite neat.

## Ludum Dare Games

The following are games I've worked on during [Ludum Dare](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111151744/http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/ashdnazg/) game jams.

{% include project-github.html name="LD26 - I don't wanna be an @" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20200809115515/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/ld26" %}
A 2D real time game written in batch.
It featured [advanced technology such as parallel rendering](https://web.archive.org/web/20150308192510/http://ludumdare.com/compo/2013/05/07/combat-debriefing-or-batch-game-architecture-101/) and terrible gameplay.

{% include project-github.html name="LD27 - Streaker 2013" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20191029135702/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/ld27" %}
You play the odd person who delights in running into football games with no clothes on.

The game won 1st place in the Humour category.

Ported to javascript with Emscripten! - [Streaker 2019](ld27)

{% include project-github.html name="LD29 - Leak" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20201030113104/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/ld29" %}
Some sort of a submarine simulator, where you control an ADHD crew by walking into rooms and shouting orders. It was barely (read: not) completed on time so wasn't much fun.

{% include project-github.html name="LD30 - Ferryman" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20191111151744/http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/ld30" %}
You play the ferryman over the river styx, ferrying the souls to the other side. You buy boats, orcas and titanics to help you deal with the ever-growing number of deaths.
The game was ok-ish but had amusing events such as demons operating a racket on your business.

{% include project-github.html name="LD32 - Gravitas" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20210421113719/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=52862" github="SpringCabal/Gravitas" %}
Created together with the [SpringCabal](https://github.com/SpringCabal), this is a puzzle/action game using the Spring engine.
My work was mostly on [music](assets/music/gravitas.ogg) and sound effects.

{% include project-github.html name="LD33 - Area 17" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20210420112638/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=52862" github="SpringCabal/Area-17" %}
Created together with the [SpringCabal](https://github.com/SpringCabal), this is a silly action game using the Spring engine.
In the game you fly around in a UFO wreaking havoc and hoovering humans for upgrades. My work was on [music](assets/music/area17.ogg), some coding and some 2D art.

{% include project-github.html name="LD34 - Ministry of Growth and Information" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20170918222123/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/ld34" %}
Created together with [Ben Tyler](https://github.com/kanatohodets), this is an amusing audio game,
where you have to listen carefully and find "subversive" messages hidden in 27 minutes of radio ([excerpt](assets/music/ministrycats.ogg)).
Writing and recording the dialogue for this game was a lot of fun but we've put in too many self-references that won't be obvious unless you've already listened to the rest of the content.
In a game jam this isn't a good idea.

{% include project-github.html name="LD35 - Tommy is the Shapeshifter" link="https://web.archive.org/web/20170917172039/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=21623" github="ashdnazg/LD35" %}
A dlalogue simulator where you convince your friends that one of them is a dangerous Shapeshifter that must be killed.
Contained between 4 and 5 minutes of voice acting.

Thanks to the lessons learnt in the previous jam, the game reached 3rd place in the Humour category.

{% include project-github.html name="LD38 - Of Course I Remember You!" link="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/of-course-i-remember-you" github="ashdnazg/LD38" %}
Created [together](https://github.com/GuyAdler) [with](https://github.com/talyyy) [the](https://github.com/Jack-Dandy) [gang](https://github.com/AnastasiaLogi).
In the game you are interrupted on your way to the toilet by people from your past and you must recall in what circumstances you met them for them to leave.

The mechanics are slightly unique and slightly cumbersome but the result was somewhat amusing and we reached 12th place in the Humour caregory.

{% include project-github.html name="Subjugate" link="https://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/subjugate" %}
A game created with a team for the 2014 [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/). It was the first game I made [music](assets/music/subjugate.ogg) for.
