I am Eshed, I may also be found under the alias ashdnazg (or due to backward compatibility reasons, hokomoko).

I'm a M.Sc student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) of [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](http://www.huji.ac.il/) where I work on Heuristic Search. My advisors are [Ariel Felner](http://felner.wix.com/home) and [Jeffrey S. Rosenschein](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/).

When I don't research, I'm a hobbyist game developer (see: {% include page_link.html title="Projects" %}).
