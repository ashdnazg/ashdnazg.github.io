I am Eshed, I may also be found under the alias ashdnazg (or due to backward compatibility reasons, hokomoko).

I currently work at [Lightricks](https://www.lightricks.com).

Previously I was a M.Sc student at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/) of [The Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://www.huji.ac.il/) where I worked on Heuristic Search. My advisors were [Ariel Felner](https://felner.wix.com/home) and [Jeffrey S. Rosenschein](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~jeff/).

When I don't work or do research, I'm a hobbyist game developer (see: {% include page_link.html title="Projects" %}).
